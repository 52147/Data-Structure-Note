## Final Note

### Tree
1. nonrecursively tree
   * consistd of a set of nodes and a set of directed edges
   * rooted tree:
     * properties:
        * 1. root node
        * 2. Every node is connected by an edge from one other node. 
             * ex: node c is connected with node p. -> Node p is c' s parent, and c is one of p's children. 
2. recursively tree

### Binary Tree
*  one node that only can have two children, which neamed them left and right
*  BT can be empty or consist a root, a left, a right.(left, right can be empty)


* uses:  
  * １.expression tree:　
    * The leaves are operands and nodes contain operator. 
    * apply in complier design
  * ２. Huffman coding tree:
    * used in data compression algorithm
    * Each alphabet is stored at a leaf
  * 3. Binary Search Tree: 
    * allows logarithmic time insertions and accessing of items, and priority queues.
